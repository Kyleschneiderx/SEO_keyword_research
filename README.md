# SEO_keyword_research
Using python and pandas I build a model that helps people take google search console data and find keywords that they'll have the best chance ranking for in the future

The main file starting with V3_SEO is the one that takes a csv file that you can get from ahref or google search console and
allows you to filter the data to find keywords that you are the most competitive to rank. The other files are just weird variations
that dont matter, but I thought id include them if anyone would also like to mess with them.
